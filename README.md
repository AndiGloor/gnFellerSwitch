# gnFellerSwitch
Library for using a Feller EDIZIOdue electronic Switch.

The Switch is a nice programmable solution that matches into existing EDIZIOdue instalations, as you find many in Switzerland.
Because you need a Switch from Feller and you most likley live in Switzerland when you like to use such a Device, the main part of the documentation is in German ([See LIESMICH.md](./LIESMICH.md)). This english Version contains just the most important links. But the code itself is documented in English, so you shoud be able to start also in English.

To understand the whole details of the product i recommend to read the manual:  [German Manual](https://mam.schneider-electric.com/public/SUM_B-AB_Elektroniktaster_94-3924_0702-D.pdf) and the [German Datasheet](https://online-katalog.feller.ch/kat_produkt_datenblatt.php?fnr=3928-1.F.L.P.61). _Languages other then German maybe available, French for sure, but no english. English readers try to read the German edition - the tecnical sentences are in English._
